### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is **Kingsley-Yoimiya**. I am from Peking University, majoring Computer Science.

Also, **Yoimiya** is my favorite character in Genshin Impact, and my last name should be Y** in Chinese, so I changed it for fun!

Currently, I'm exploring the GitHub commuity and searching the fields which I might be intersted in.

### Current Tools
- Ubuntu(Kubuntu actually)
- Siyuan Notebook
- Emacs & Vscode
- Anki
- Edge

### Current Status
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScripts(Fun!), Functional Programming(It's a required course in my major. It's endurable for me in difficulties but I am not **extremely** intersted in it.)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email(kingsley_yoimiya@outlook.com). Other ways are coming(maybe because of the internet limitation in China)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am trying to learn Psychology too!
